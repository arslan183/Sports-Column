# How Kohli Conquered the Britishers Despite Losing 4-1
## Redemption or Revenge
Kohli's 2018 was not against England only it was also against kohli himself from 2014.
For Kohli 2018 had many strings which were connected to 2014 India tour of England .
It all started in 2014 when young Kohli toured first time for England to play Test matches,
he was also present in 2012 but only for the white ball matches .Kohli made his Test debut in 2011 against west Indies and he was yet to prove his worth in Test matches.A big opportunity was awaiting 
Kohli to shut all the critics who were doubting him and questioning his place in Test squad,but before he could prove himself  the English pace attack specially "James Michael Anderson" found a flaw in his technique and that flaw became his weakness which he couldn't takle during whole tour.
Kohli loves playing a shot which is known as **Cover Drive** in cricketing world and no doubt about it that this shot is most aestheciallly pleasing shot. In England Test matches are played with Dukes balls and these balls are known for *swing* and *seam* movements and due to these extra movements 
batter kohli faced difficulties in playing his favourite shot and everytime he leans to play that shot an outside edge awaits to get carried in **Slip Cordon** .During whole series Kohli couldn't resist himself from playing that shot and he kept getting out the same way. James Anderson was literally toying with him Kohli's dismissals were like repeat telecast of previous innings English **Pace Attack** literally broke him on that tour his scores were **1,8,25,0,39,28,0,7,6,20** and out of **10** dismissals **6** were cought behind.
Now come to 2018 India tour of England --To be Continued--
